Introduction
------------
Cheese Quest is a text-based adventure game, or more commonly referred to as interactive fiction, inspired by many of the games published by Infocom in the 1980s. It takes approximately 2 hour to complete.


While Cheese Quest is already complete, further development on it has been
abandoned in favour of
[Agrippa's Trilemma](https://github.com/EvanQuan/AgrippasTrilemma),
which is being built in Java from scratch.

[You can read why, as well as more about the game here.](https://github.com/EvanQuan/CheeseQuest/wiki)
